For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
I taught at Confucius Institute for three years part-time and volunteered to teach and travel to 32 countries.
