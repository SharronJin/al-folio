Hi! I'm Sharron (Luyang) Jin and I'm a masters student in Education at Oxford University.

My interdisciplinary backgrounds in International Media and Communications Studies, as well as Higher Education, has offered me further insights into the role of education in the rapidly changing global context, as well as its interrelations with the economic, social, and political development.

I am skilled at many instruments, and achieved the highest-level certificate (grade 10) in piano playing. I also enjoy sports, and was the secretary for the Oxford University Gliding Club.
